# data_science_projects

>This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks that I have worked on while trying to learn about machine learning and data cleaning in the context of data science.

There are currently two Python scripts that are used in the notebooks that can be installed uisng the ```setup.py``` script. These are ```simple_neural_net.py``` and ```tensorflow_neural_net.py```, which are contained in the Python folder.

To install these, you can run
```
python setup.py install --user
```

They are used in the ```simple_nn_with_mushrooms.pynb``` and ```tensorflow_with_medical_insurance.ipynb``` within the ```notebooks/my_projects``` folder.

```simple_neural_net.py``` is a set of Python functions that I wrote while doing the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) Coursera course, which is part of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

```tensorflow_neural_net.py``` is an ongoing attempt to recast and improve ```simple_neural_net.py``` in Tensorflow (with the Keras API), using methods introduced to me while doing the [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning) course, which is also part of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).


## Folders

The ```data``` folder contains all of the data used within the notebooks.

The ```notebooks``` folder contains the main projects that I have been working on.

In ```notebooks/example_notebooks``` there are a coupe of notebooks that I downloaded from Kaggle to help get me started. I have recast them, with some modifictions/extensions in ```notebooks/initial_notebooks```.

In ```notebooks/my_projects``` there are two projects from Kaggle.

In ```notebooks/data_cleaning``` there are two projects where I have started with unclean data.
