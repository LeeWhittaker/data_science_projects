## Courese taken on Coursera

### Enroled

[DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
* This is a specialization course aiming at developing the deep learning skills required to move into the field of AI.
* A link to all the certificates gained within this specialization is given [here](https://coursera.org/share/218ca33e1dd94cb279cede7d93b27f5a)

Courses within this specialization:
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)
    * Here, we are shown the building blocks a basic neural networks and introduced to shallow and deep learning.
* [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
    * This course discusses more practical aspects of deep learning, with a focus on optimization and hyperparameter tuning.
* [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)
    * This course introducing methods to better strategize machine learning algorithms, such as using error anaylysis and transfer learning.
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)
    * An introduction to the basics of convolutional neural networks, with a look at deep networks, object detection, and neural style transfer.
* [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
    * Looks at recurrent neural networks, natural language processing, and attention mechanisms

### Audited

I have audited three courses within [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python). These are
